Tasks
Symmetric matrix
Create a function named isSymmetric that takes an n√ón integer matrix (two dimensional array/list)
 as a parameter and returns true if the matrix is symmetric or false if it is not.

Symmetric means it has identical values along its diagonal axis from top-left to bottom-right,
 as in the first example.

Example 1:

[
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 2, 2],
  [1, 2, 5]
]
Output:

true
Example 2:

[
  [7, 7, 7],
  [6, 5, 7],
  [1, 2, 1]
]
Output:

false
