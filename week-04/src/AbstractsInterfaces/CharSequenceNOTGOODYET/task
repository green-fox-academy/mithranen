# Implement CharSequence

- Check out the
  [CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/CharSequence.html)
  interface
!- Create a `Gnirts` class implementing this interface
  !- It should have one `String` field that can be set via the constructor
  - Your solution should be a class that represents a reversed String. Implement
    its methods accordingly. E.g. if the Gnirts is constructed with the String
    "example" then the character at the 2nd index is 'p'
  - In a `main` method try out all the methods
- Create a `ShiftedCharSequence` class implementing this interface
  - This CharSequence can be constructed using the following arguments:
    - a String (that is to be shifted)
    - a number (which defines how many characters to shift)
  - Implement the methods so that the sequence is shifted by the defined number
    of characters

```java
Gnirts gnirts = new Gnirts("example");
System.out.println(gnirts.charAt(1));
// should print out: l

ShiftedCharSequence shifter = new ShiftedCharSequence("example", 2);
System.out.println(shifter.charAt(0));
// should print out: a
